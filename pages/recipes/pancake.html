        <p>With our Homemade Mix, you’re already halfway there to a stack of warm, fluffy pancakes—just add milk, oil, an egg, and a touch of sugar for a super simple batter. Enjoy pancakes with a pat of butter and maple syrup, or mix it up with one of our delicious flavor variations. Mocha chip pancakes, anyone?

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3> 
        <p>In medium bowl or measuring cup, whisk together milk, egg, and oil until smooth. In large bowl, whisk together pancake mix and sugar; make well in center and gradually whisk in milk mixture until mostly smooth (some small lumps are OK).</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3> 
        <p>Heat large nonstick skillet or griddle on medium until drop of water sizzles. In batches, add scant 1/4-cupfuls of batter. Cook until surface is bubbly and edges are set, 2 to 3 minutes. With wide spatula, gently flip; cook 1 to 2 minutes. Serve right away or keep warm on baking sheet in 225°F oven. </p>
