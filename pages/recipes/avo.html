        <p>Smashed avocado toast with egg is one of the best brunch recipes out there. 
            It's been all over restaurant menus, but our easy recipe really takes the cake for its simplicity,
            and it's so simple to incorporate into your daily breakfast routine. 
            We smashed avocado with lemon juice, salt, and pepper, 
            and spread a generous layer onto hearty toast. 
            Then we topped it off with the perfect hard-boiled egg, 
            thinly sliced radishes for a springy touch, and a sprinkle of flavorful chives and sesame seeds.

            And while we kept it simple, this avocado toast recipe is elegant 
            enough to include on any brunch menu â€” perhaps the perfect treat for Mom on Mother's Day 
            or a delicious addition for Easter Brunch! You could also add a fried or poached egg, 
            or top it off with crumbled bacon, sliced scallions, or even a drizzle of pesto. 
            Try setting up an avocado toast bar with your favorite toppers, 
            and let your friends and family choose their own adventure.

        <h2>But, wait ... is smashed avocado healthy?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes! This creamy fruit is full of fiber, potassium, vitamin C, and healthy fats that help to lower bad cholesterol. It is the ideal vegan sub for mayo to conjure a soft texture without unnecessary calories. Try smashed avocado on bread when making a healthy sandwich or add to a salad to help keep you full longer. It's time to load up on avocado, crunchy toast, and hard-boiled eggs for a filling breakfast that tastes great!
